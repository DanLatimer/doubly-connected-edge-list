CS 6345 - Spatial Data Structures
Final Project - Doubly Connected Edge List
Daniel Latimer

My project is to construct a doubly connected edge list (DCEL) from an input file containing topological data. I decided to accept GML 1.0 as input as it is a well known open standard, and construct and display the DCEL using microsoft windows' GDI+ graphics engine. I added a KDTree to index verticies so we can perform orthogonal range searches.

For information as to what the DCEL and KDTree can do please read my project report: /final_project_report.pdf
